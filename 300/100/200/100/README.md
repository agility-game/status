# 100 - Create your own repo from Renderâ€™s SvelteKit template repo on GitHub (you may need to log in first).

Click https://github.com/render-examples/sveltekit/generate and name the repository ```kene``` for owner ```agility-game```. Make sure to check the box **Include all branches**

**NOTE**: Instead of staying with the example, we'll update the repository with the content of https://github.com/rajnandan1/kene and also name the repository ```kene```.
