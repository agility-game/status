# 300 - Building Our Application

You can choose to deploy it as a [Node Server](https://docs.render.com/deploy-sveltekit#deploy-as-a-node-server) or [Static Site](https://docs.render.com/deploy-sveltekit#deploy-as-a-static-site).

The key difference is that the app deployed as a Node server is built using the [SvelteKit Node.js adapter](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-node). The static site uses the [SvelteKit static adapter](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-static) to generate static HTML for all pages.
