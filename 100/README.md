# 100 - Introduction

[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) is an exciting new development from the folks who created [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). While Svelte is great for static site creation, SvelteKit is a framework for building high-performance web applications. It includes routing, code-splitting, offline support, and server-rendered views with client-side hydration. Each page of a SvelteKit app is actually a Svelte component!

In this repository we create a SvelteKit app based on "Kener" and deploy it to render.com to monitor our Agility Game instances.
